                The news system was developed with the goal of providing a
                simple and intuitive platform for displaying and managing
                journalistic content. Through this application, users can access
                recent news, view full details of each article, and easily
                navigate through different categories and topics.

                This project aims to showcase my skills in front-end development
                with React, API integration, and best UX/UI practices, while
                also presenting a practical and functional solution for online
                news consumption.
